\usage{
nonlinearity(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a univariate time series}
}
\value{
A numeric value.
}
\description{
Computes a nonlinearity statistic based on Terasvirta's nonlinearity test of a time series.
The statistic is \eqn{10X^2/T}{10X^2/T} where \eqn{X^2}{X^2} is the Chi-squared statistic from 
Terasvirta's test, and T is the length of the time series. This takes large values
when the series is nonlinear, and values around 0 when the series is linear.
